# Java Banking Application with Virtual ATM Machine - MVC Based Application

## **1. Introduction**
Overview of the Project
The Java Banking Application with Virtual ATM Machine is a comprehensive and user-friendly banking application that emulates an ATM machine. The project is built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.***You Can also change the name of the bank according to you choice(Just change in FirstView.java file )***

### Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this application is to provide users with a safe and convenient way to perform banking operations, such as managing their accounts, making withdrawals, checking balances, and more, through an ATM-like interface. The application ensures the security and confidentiality of user data using various techniques like hashing and SQL injection protection.

### Technology Stack: Java Ant-based Application Developed using NetBeans
The project is developed using Java with the build automation tool Apache Ant. NetBeans, a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is used to facilitate code development, debugging, and project management.

### MVC Design Pattern
The MVC design pattern divides the application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. This pattern enhances code organization, simplifies maintenance, and promotes code reusability.

## **2. Features**
User Signup and Login
Users can register for an account by providing their personal details through a signup form. Upon successful registration, users can log in using their credentials to access their accounts and perform transactions.

### Database Connectivity with MySQL
The application integrates with MySQL, a robust relational database management system, to store user account information securely.

### Secure Data Storage using SHA-512 Hash Algorithm
To ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data, such as Mobile Phone Numbers (MPN) and PIN numbers, the application employs the SHA-512 hash algorithm. Hashing transforms data into irreversible encrypted formats, enhancing data security.

### Protection against SQL Injection Attacks
The application uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks, ensuring that malicious SQL code cannot be executed on the database.

### ATM Machine Interface
The ATM machine interface provides users with a familiar and intuitive environment to perform banking transactions efficiently.

### Transaction Operations
Users can perform various transaction operations, including crediting funds, debiting funds, checking their account balance, and inquiring about recent transactions.

## 3. **MVC Architecture**
### Model
The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It includes the data structure that stores user records and manages the interaction with the database.

### View
The View handles the user interface components, ensuring that users can interact with the application seamlessly. It includes multiple view classes for different screens and forms.

### Controller
The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View components. It processes user inputs, updates the Model accordingly, and triggers updates in the View.

## **4. Implementation Details**
Data Structures
The application utilizes appropriate data structures to efficiently store and manage user account information and transaction details.

### Database Schema
The database schema is designed to accommodate user account information, transaction logs, and other relevant data.

### Code Snippets
Selected code snippets are provided to highlight essential components and functionality within the application.

## **5. Security Features**
Hashing Sensitive Data
The application uses the SHA-512 hash algorithm to convert sensitive data (e.g., MPN, PIN) into a secure, irreversible format.

### Prepared Statements for SQL Injection Protection
By utilizing prepared statements, the application mitigates the risk of SQL injection attacks and enhances overall database security.

## **6. User Interface (UI) Overview**
### Login Form

### Data Storage and Retrieval
The process of storing user data into the database and retrieving relevant information for display is outlined.

## **8. How the Application Works**
User Signup and Login Process
A step-by-step explanation of the user registration and login process is provided.

ATM Transaction Flow
The flow of an ATM transaction, from user input to data processing, is described in detail.

## **9. Future Enhancements and Improvements**
Scaling the Application
Ideas for scaling the application to accommodate a growing user base are proposed.

### Additional Security Measures
Suggestions for enhancing security further and safeguarding against emerging threats are discussed.

### User Experience Improvements
Potential improvements to the user interface and overall user experience are recommended.

## **10. Conclusion**
The Java Banking Application with Virtual ATM Machine is a secure and user-friendly platform that emulates an ATM experience. Developed using Java with Apache Ant and NetBeans IDE, it follows the MVC design pattern. Users can perform banking transactions securely through the intuitive ATM interface, while sensitive data is protected using SHA-512 hashing and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
